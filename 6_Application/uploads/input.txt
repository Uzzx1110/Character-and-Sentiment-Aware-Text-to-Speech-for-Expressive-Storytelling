Lena stood at the edge of the lake, watching the sky turn gold. She had come here every summer since she was a kid, but this time felt different. College was two weeks away. Everything was about to change. Behind her, Milo skipped rocks across the water, quiet as always. They had been best friends since second grade. They both knew this was goodbye, even if no one said it. A few feet away, Ava and Theo argued over which road trip playlist was better, their voices loud, trying to drown the silence. Zara sat on the dock, legs in the water, sketching the lake without looking up. Lena envied how calm she seemed. The group had always worked—different people, one shared summer. But things break when school ends and life begins. Milo finally spoke: “Will we still come here next year?” No one answered. Maybe they would. Maybe they wouldn’t. That night, they built a fire, shared burnt marshmallows, and told the same old stories. When it got late, they packed up in silence. Lena took one last look at the lake, the trees, her friends. Then she whispered, “Let’s not call it goodbye.” No one argued.
