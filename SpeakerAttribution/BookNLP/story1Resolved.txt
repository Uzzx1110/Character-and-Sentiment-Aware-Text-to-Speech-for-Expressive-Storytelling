In a small town named Mathville, lived two best friends, Algy and Sammy. 
two best friends, Algy and Sammy loved solving puzzles and riddles together. 
One sunny day, two best friends, Algy and Sammy found a mysterious note on two best friends, Algy and Sammy's favorite park bench. 
a mysterious note read, “Solve -1147 = -11*a - 1213 for ‘a’. What is the answer?”
Algy, being good at numbers, decided to take up the challenge. 
Algy explained to Sammy, “First, we need to get ‘a’ alone. To do that, let’s add 1213 to both sides of the equation.” 
So, two best friends, Algy and Sammy added 1213 to -1147, making it 66.
Next, Algy said, “Now, we simplify both sides to make our work easier!” And voila! Both sides became 66. 
Excitedly, Algy shared Algy's next step with Sammy: “Let’s divide both sides by -11 now, so we can finally see what ‘a’ equals!" 
A little confused, Sammy asked, “But won’t negative divided by negative give us positive? Why would we want to use minus here?"
With a smile, Algy replied, “Great question, Sammy! Yes, usually, negative divided by negative gives us positive. 
But when you divide a number by itself – no matter its sign – the result will always be 1 or, in this case, -1 since we have a negative 
number. That way, we maintain balance between the left and right side of the equation." After dividing, two best friends, Algy and Sammy 
discovered that \'a\' was equal to -6.\n\nAs two best friends, Algy and Sammy were about to celebrate two best friends, Algy and Sammy's 
success, This bewildering spectacle happened. Suddenly, all the numbers around two best friends, Algy and Sammy started changing rapidly 
before two best friends, Algy and Sammy's eyes. Trees turned into formulas, flowers transformed into equations, even birds chirped out 
integers. This bewildering spectacle made everyone realize how deeply intertwined math was with nature. Sometimes, unveiling answers 
leads us to surprising realizations. Though things didn\'t go back to normal immediately, two best friends, Algy and Sammy learned an 
essential lesson: Every discovery brings new wonders worth exploring.
