Narrator,"In a small town named Mathville, lived two best friends, Algy and Sammy. They loved solving puzzles and riddles together. One sunny day, they found a mysterious note on their favorite park bench. It read,"
Sammy,Solve -1147 = -11*a - 1213 for ‘a’. What is the answer?
Narrator,"Algy, being good at numbers, decided to take up the challenge. He explained to Sammy,"
Algy,"First, we need to get ‘a’ alone. To do that, let’s add 1213 to both sides of the equation."
Narrator,"So, they added 1213 to -1147, making it 66.

Next, Algy said,"
Algy,"Now, we simplify both sides to make our work easier!"
Narrator,"And voila! Both sides became 66. Excitedly, he shared his next step with Sammy:"
Algy,"Let’s divide both sides by -11 now, so we can finally see what ‘a’ equals!"
Narrator,"A little confused, Sammy asked,"
Sammy,But won’t negative divided by negative give us positive? Why would we want to use minus here?
Narrator,"With a smile, Algy replied,"
Algy,"Great question, Sammy! Yes, usually, negative divided by negative gives us positive. But when you divide a number by itself – no matter its sign – the result will always be 1 or, in this case, -1 since we have a negative number. That way, we maintain balance between the left and right side of the equation."
Narrator,"After dividing, they discovered that 'a' was equal to -6.

As they were about to celebrate their success, something unexpected happened. Suddenly, all the numbers around them started changing rapidly before their eyes. Trees turned into formulas, flowers transformed into equations, even birds chirped out integers. This bewildering spectacle made everyone realize how deeply intertwined math was with nature. Sometimes, unveiling answers leads us to surprising realizations. Though things didn't go back to normal immediately, they learned an essential lesson: Every discovery brings new wonders worth exploring."
